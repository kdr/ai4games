Sound Effects for Type Type Revolution

The game code is looking for the following sound files in this directory:

1. perfect.mp3 - A high, bright sound for perfect hits (like a high bell or chime)
2. good.mp3 - A medium-pitched sound for good hits (like a medium bell or ding)
3. ok.mp3 - A lower sound for ok hits (like a low bell)
4. miss.mp3 - A negative sound for missed hits (like a short buzz or thud)

You can either:
1. Create your own sound effects with these filenames
2. Download free sound effects and rename them to match these filenames
3. Use a sound generation tool or service to create these sounds

The game will automatically play these sounds based on your timing accuracy when hitting the keys.

For the best experience, keep the sounds short (under 0.5 seconds) and make sure they're distinct enough to tell apart during gameplay.
